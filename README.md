<h1>This is a simple programm writen in c that encrypts and decrypts text using Caesar and Vigenere ciphers.</h1>

<h2> Considerations: </h2>

<h3> It still lacks some functionality and has bugs.</h3>
<p>If you build this programm using GNU Compiler Collection (GCC):</p>
<p>gcc main.c -o main.o</p>
</p>(Instead of main.o you can put other names and file extentions like for example cypher.exe or output.obj)</h5>

On Linux you can launch it with ./main.o
On Windows if you compiled it with .exe extention you can just double click it

Some feachures of the program depend on having a text file in the same folder

As of this moment it only processes capital letters and does not handle well unusual symbols like: %$/("</p>
