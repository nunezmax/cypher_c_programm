# cypher_c_programm
This is simple programm writen in c that encrypts and decrypts text using Caesar and Vigenere ciphers.
It still lacks some functionality and has bugs.

Considerations:
If you build this programm using GNU Compiler Collection (GCC):
gcc main.c -o main.o  (Instead of main.o you can put other names and file extentions like for example cypher.exe or output.obj)

On Linux you can launch it with ./main.o
On Windows if you compiled it with .exe extention you can just double click it

Some feachures of the program depend on having a text file in the same folder

As of this moment it only processes capital letters and does not handle well unusual symbols like: %$/("
